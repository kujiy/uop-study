Abstract
 The Code of Ethics for the University of the People (UoPeople) Faculty and Staff has been created by Group Project 0012B consultants as a foundational document that aims to foster ethical behavior, integrity, and professionalism within the institution. It is a framework that should guide faculty and staff toward following principles and standards. The consultants identified the key components in this paper and included them as part of the Code of Ethics to uphold the values and principles of the UoPeople.

Section 1: One Page Rationale
 In developing our Code of Ethics, we engaged in numerous discussions. In the process, some items were adopted, and some were excluded. This section presents the results of those discussions.
 The Code of Ethics for the University of the People (UoPeople) Faculty and Staff has been created by Group Project 0012B consultants as a foundational document that aims to foster ethical behavior, integrity, and professionalism within the institution. It is a framework that should guide faculty and staff toward following principles and standards. The following key components were identified by the consultants and included as part of the Code of Ethics to uphold the values and principles of the UoPeople.
 The consultants decided to include discrimination and harassment because they are important for UoPeople. This institution promotes an inclusive and secure environment based on respect. Employees are encouraged to report wrongdoing to keep the institutional environment healthy and safe. UoPeople promotes employee well-being while also advancing sustainability initiatives. UoPeople supports ethical conduct and accountability by adhering to compliance and legal standards, safeguarding its reputation, and mitigating potential legal consequences.
Furthermore, another important section was confidentiality and privacy of information, as it is important always to protect sensitive information to safeguard not only the rights of students but also faculty and staff. Conflict of interest should also be included in all codes of ethics. It is beneficial and important to all industries as it promotes transparency in the decision-making processes and discourages bias or unethical conduct. Hence, an environment of fairness encourages a culture of openness and accountability that protects individuals who raise concerns. For that reason, non-retaliation is also a section that the consultants agreed to include. Lastly, the section on consequences of violation was also included to encourage everyone to stay within the boundaries of ethics and the established code.
On the other hand, the code of ethics established by the Academy of International Business (2018) is specifically designed for academic publishing. It may not directly correspond with the needs and objectives of the UoPeople community. The consultants acknowledged the significance of elements like discrimination, harassment, and enforcement procedures but decided to exclude sections that were not directly relevant to UoPeople's faculty and staff. The consultants concentrated on elements that tackle the specific ethical challenges and considerations at UoPeople, ensuring that the code of ethics aligns with the institution's values, commitments, and operational context.
The components discussed are fundamental to the UoPeople Faculty and Staff Code of Ethics. The code establishes a framework for ethical behavior while fostering a culture of trust, accountability, and integrity. Therefore, it is essential to recognize UoPeople's dedication to maintaining values and fulfilling its mission with integrity and excellence.



Section 2: Type of Ethics


Section 3: Sustainability
Introduction to Sustainability in the Context of UoPeople
Sustainability is critical for any organization committed to ethical practices and long-term impact. At the University of the People (UoPeople), sustainability transcends environmental concerns to encompass economic, social, and institutional responsibilities. By incorporating sustainability into the Code of Conduct, UoPeople reinforces its commitment to building an equitable, resilient, and resource-efficient organization that supports its objective of providing accessible and high-quality education (University of the People, 2024).
Sustainability at UoPeople is recognized as the responsible use of resources—whether environmental, human, or institutional—to ensure the continuity of its operations and services without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The Brundtland Report has inspired this definition, emphasizing sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Epstein & Buhovac, 2014).
This section outlines the expectations, commitments, and actions related to sustainability for all UoPeople faculty and staff.

Guiding Principles of Sustainability in the Code of Conduct
1.	Environmental Responsibility
Faculty and staff must consider and practice resource conservation in our daily operations, as acts of minimizing waste, reducing energy usage, and adopting environmentally friendly technologies are responsible and feasible (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). At UoPeople, we are encouraged to utilize digital platforms for documentation, communication, and education to reduce the institution's carbon footprint.
These adaptations significantly decrease environmental impacts by reducing reliance on paper and energy-intensive physical infrastructure (Sheth et al., 2010). Sustainable procurement practices are encouraged whenever possible, prioritizing vendors who align with eco-friendly and ethical practices.

2.	Economic Sustainability
Employees must support UoPeople's commitment to financial responsibility by guaranteeing cost-effective resource allocation, eliminating unnecessary expenses, and increasing operational efficiency. Faculty and staff should consider long-term institutional sustainability and support attempts to balance budgetary health and educational access. According to research, academic institutions' financial sustainability supports their ability to provide quality services over time (Clark, 2014).

3.	Social Sustainability
UoPeople employees and instructors must provide an inclusive, supportive, and collaborative work environment that embraces diversity and equity. Promoting open discourse, respect for opposing viewpoints, and ongoing professional growth is critical to ensuring a sustainable workforce. Faculty and staff must follow ethical principles when interacting with students, colleagues, and stakeholders, stressing respect, empathy, and accountability (Hargreaves & Fink, 2003).

4.	Educational Sustainability
According to Tilbury (2011), incorporating sustainability principles into teaching and curriculum is essential for fostering a comprehensive understanding of global and local issues among students. This is why, at our institution, staff and students are taught to embrace innovations that enhance the quality and accessibility of education while ensuring the longevity of its delivery systems. Therefore, applying digital tools, for instance, supports educational access and sustainability goals (Sheth et al., 2010).

Implementation and Accountability
1.	Compliance and Continuous Improvement
a.	Teachers and staff must adhere to these sustainability principles while actively seeking ways to enhance their practices.
b.	Any activities or choices incompatible with UoPeople's sustainability goals should be reported immediately to the appropriate department or authority.
2.	Monitoring and Reporting
a.	Scheduled and random reviews will be used to assess actionable adherence to sustainability standards, where updates and revisions are made to the Code of Conduct to address emerging challenges and opportunities. Our accountability stewards will be paramount in achieving this success.
3.	Training and Awareness
a.	To align with UoPeople's sustainability goals, ongoing training will be provided to faculty and staff. This training will equip them with the knowledge and tools to implement best practices effectively.
Exclusions and Limitations
 The sustainability principle in this Code of Conduct is unique to UoPeople's activities and prohibits personal hobbies unrelated to work-related tasks. Furthermore, while UoPeople believes in social and environmental responsibility, the organization recognizes that not all recommended practices can be implemented immediately due to resource restrictions (Brown et al. 2005). Within these constraints, teachers and staff should prioritize realistic solutions.
 The sustainability principle in this Code of Conduct is specific to UoPeople's operations and forbids personal hobbies unrelated to work-related obligations. Furthermore, while UoPeople values social and environmental responsibility, the organization acknowledges that not all recommended practices can be implemented immediately due to resource constraints (Brown et al. 2005). Within these limits, teachers and administrators should prioritize practical solutions.



Section 4: Specific Policies
Discrimination
The University of the People (UoPeople) is committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable learning environment. Discrimination based on race, gender, age, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other protected characteristic is strictly prohibited (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, n.d.). All members of the university community must uphold the values of respect and equality in their interactions. Violations will result in disciplinary action ranging from warnings to expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense.

Harassment
Harassment, whether verbal, physical, or digital, undermines the core values of UoPeople. This includes any unwelcome conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for students, faculty, or staff (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). Examples include but are not limited to bullying, sexual harassment, and cyber harassment. UoPeople enforces a zero-tolerance policy for such behaviors, with consequences that may include suspension, termination of enrollment, or legal action.

Confidentiality
The confidentiality of academic records, communications, and sensitive information is a cornerstone of UoPeople's operations. Students and staff must ensure that all shared information, particularly within team projects and academic discussions, remains private unless explicitly authorized for disclosure (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, n.d.). Breaches of confidentiality will be met with corrective actions, including possible suspension or removal from the program.

Privacy of Information
 Protecting the privacy of personal and academic data is a top priority. UoPeople complies with global privacy standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure that all student, faculty, and staff information is securely stored and processed (GDPR, 2018). Unauthorized access, sharing, or misuse of private information will be considered a grave offense, warranting immediate investigation and disciplinary measures.

Conflict of Interest
To maintain integrity and trust within the UoPeople community, all members must disclose any real or perceived conflicts of interest. This includes but is not limited to financial, professional, or personal relationships that may compromise impartiality (U.S. Office of Government Ethics, 2020). Members must promptly report conflicts of interest to the appropriate university authority. Failure to disclose conflicts may result in disciplinary actions, including removal from decision-making roles or dismissal from the university.

Non-Retaliation
 UoPeople upholds a strict non-retaliation policy to protect individuals who report misconduct or participate in investigations. Retaliatory actions, such as intimidation, threats, or discrimination, against individuals who report violations of the Code of Conduct will not be tolerated. Retaliation will result in severe penalties, including possible expulsion or termination of employment (American Psychological Association, 2017).

Consequences of Violations
Violations of the Code of Conduct undermine the mission and values of UoPeople. Disciplinary measures will depend on the nature and severity of the misconduct and may include:
1.	Warnings: Issued for minor infractions as a corrective measure.
2.	Probation: Temporary restrictions placed on privileges within the UoPeople community.
3.	Suspension: Temporary removal from academic or professional roles at the university.
4.	Expulsion: Permanent removal from the university community.
5.	Legal Action: Pursued in cases involving criminal behavior or violations of applicable laws.
UoPeople ensures a sustainable, respectful, and productive academic environment by adhering to these policies.



Conclusion
The Code of Ethics for the University of the People (UoPeople) Faculty and Staff is a comprehensive document that outlines the ethical standards, sustainability principles, and specific policies that guide the conduct of all employees and instructors. By integrating sustainability into the Code of Conduct, UoPeople demonstrates its commitment to responsible practices that support the institution's long-term success and impact. The Code of Ethics serves as a foundational framework for fostering a culture of integrity, respect, and accountability within the UoPeople community. It is essential for all faculty and staff to familiarize themselves with the Code of Ethics and uphold its principles in their daily interactions and decision-making processes. By adhering to these ethical standards, UoPeople can continue to provide accessible, high-quality education while promoting sustainability, diversity, and excellence in all its endeavors.
